Covid-19 Linelist Compilation
==========================

Scripts to import, clean, and compile Covid-19 linelists.


## Cleaning and standardization

#### 1. Numeric variables

Includes variables `patinfo_ageonset`, `MSF_delay_before_admission`,
`MSF_length_stay`, and `outcome_contacts_followed`.

We coerce all non-missing values to numeric format. For values that cannot be
converted automatically, we make a manual correction (if possible) as tracked in
the dictionary data-raw/linelist/cleaning/dictionaries/dict_numeric_correct.xlsx

_Example_
```
Original                    To numeric                  Manually corrected
------------------          ------------------          ------------------
  patinfo_ageonset            patinfo_ageonset            patinfo_ageonset
1               40          1               40          1               40
2                3    ->    2                3    ->    2                3
3                ?          3             <NA>          3             <NA>
4               28          4               28          4               28
5              25,          5             <NA>          5               25
```

In the example above, original age values `?` and `25,` cannot be automatically
converted to numeric. The value `?` is converted to a missing value (`<NA>`)
which we cannot correct any further (without input from the field). The value
`25,` is manually corrected to `25` (after e.g. checking the corresponding value
of variable `MSF_job` to ensure that the patient is not a child, in which case
perhaps the age should have been `2.5`), as reflected in the dictionary
dict_numeric_correct.xlsx:
```
          variable   value  replacement
1 patinfo_ageonset     25,           25
```

#### 2. Date variables

Includes variables `report_date`, `Lab_date1`, `patcourse_dateonset`,
`MSF_symptom_*_date_onset`, `MSF_date_consultation`, `patcourse_presHCF`,
`patcourse_dateiso`, `expo_travel_date_*`, `expo_case_date_*`,
`outcome_submitted_date`, `outcome_patcourse_presHCF`,
`outcome_date_of_outcome`, and `outcome_lab_date`.

We coerce all non-missing values to date format (YYYY-MM-DD). For values that
cannot be converted automatically, we make a manual correction (if possible) as
tracked in the dictionary
data-raw/linelist/cleaning/dictionaries/dict_dates.xlsx

We then implement a variety of tests to check for logical consistency among the
various date values for each patient (TODO).

#### 3. Coded-list variables (excluding geocoding)

First we standardize all values using `hmatch::string_std()`, which converts
strings to lowercase, removes diacritics, and replaces sequences of
space/punctuation with "_". We then match the standardized strings to the
original coded-list selections as they appear in the drop-down menus, based on
the dictionary data-raw/linelist/cleaning/dictionaries/dict_factors.xlsx

Finally, for values that are still not matched to a dictionary entry, we make a
manual correction (if possible) as tracked in the dictionary
data-raw/linelist/cleaning/dictionaries/dict_factors_correct.xlsx

_Example_
```
Original              Standardized          Dictionary matched    Manually corrected
------------------    ------------------    ------------------    ------------------
  MSF_covid_status      MSF_covid_status      MSF_covid_status      MSF_covid_status
1 Not a case          1 not_a_case          1 Not a case          1 Not a case
2 CONFIRMED       ->  2 confirmed       ->  2 Confirmed       ->  2 Confirmed
3 Non-case            3 non_case            3 <NA>                3 Not a case
4 Not_a_case          4 not_a_case          4 Not a case          4 Not a case
5 suspected           5 suspected           5 Suspected           5 Suspected
6 Died                6 died                6 <NA>                6 <NA>
```

In the example above, original values `Non-case` and `Died` cannot be
automatically matched to a valid dictionary entry, even after
format-standardization. The value `Died` is converted to a missing value
(`<NA>`) which we cannot correct any further (without input from the field). The
format-standardized value `non_case` is manually corrected to the valid version
`Not a case`, as reflected in the dictionary dict_factors_correct.xlsx:

```
  variable          value     replacement
1 MSF_covid_status  non_case  Not a case
```

#### 4. Geocoding

The residence location variable `MSF_admin_location_past_week` represents up to
four administrative levels separated by " | ". We start by splitting this
variable into the four composite variables, named `adm*_name__res_raw` (the
original variable is also retained).

We then attempt to match each set of admin locations to the corresponding set
within the shapefile for the relevant country using
[`hmatch::hmatch()`](https://github.com/epicentre-msf/hmatch). For location
values that remain unmatched, we make a manual match to the shapefile (if
possible) as tracked in the dictionaries [TODO].

_Example (note we omit the adm4 level here for brevity)_
```
  Original variable                 Original values split into separate variables
  ----------------------------      --------------------------------------------------------
  MSF_admin_location_past_week      adm1_name__res_raw adm2_name__res_raw adm3_name__res_raw
1 New York | Eerie | Buffalo        New York           Eerie              Buffalo
2 Philadelphia | Allegheny | Ville  Philadelphia       Allegheny          Ville
3 New York | Rochester              New York           Rochester          <NA>              ...
4 Philadelphia                      Philadelphia       <NA>               <NA>
5 New Jersey | NJ/Essex             New Jersey         NJ/Essex           <NA>

  Shapefile-matched admin names
  --------------------------------------------
  adm1_name__res adm2_name__res adm3_name__res
1 New York       Erie           Buffalo
2 Philadelphia   Allegheny      <NA>
3 New York       Rochester      <NA>          ...
4 Philadelphia   <NA>           <NA>
5 New Jersey     Essex          <NA>

  Shapefile-matched admin codes
  -------------------------------------------------------
  adm1_pcode__res adm2_pcode__res         adm3_pcode__res
1 new_york        new_york__erie          new_york__erie__buffalo
2 philadelphia    philadelphia__allegheny <NA>
3 new_york        new_york__rochester     <NA>
4 philadelphia    <NA>                    <NA>
5 new_jersey      new_jersey__essex       <NA>
```
In the example above there were 3 mismatches between the linelist and shapefile:

- Line 1: "Eerie" in the linelist is spelled "Erie" in the shapefile. This
mismatch is close enough (â‰¤2 characters) that fuzzy matching with the function
`hmatch::hmatch()` will handle it automatically.
- Line 2: There is no adm3 level "Ville" within the shapefile, and we are unable
to find a match manually, so the clean variables (`adm*_name__res` and
`adm*_pcode__res`) will only have non-missing values up to the adm2 level.
- Line 5: There is no adm2 level "NJ/Essex" in the shapefile, but we determine
manually that this likely corresponds to "Essex", and add the correction to the
relevant dictionary.
